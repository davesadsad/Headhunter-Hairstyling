                <span><strong>May 4, 2020 - We are open!</strong><br>
                    We are pleased to say that we have been serving guests for three days
                     so far, following the strict guidelines, and at a reduced capacity. 
                     It is definitely a different way of working, but we are happy to see 
                     our guests and be back at work.<br>
                     We are operating by appointment only, so if you need servicing, please
                      feel free to reach out or book an appointment online! Stay safe friends!

                    <strong>April 30, 2020 - Our stylists will begin servicing clients at reduced
                         capacity on May 1st. Here are the precautions we are taking.</strong><br>
                         We have been hard at work all week to make sure we are taking all the 
                         precautions necessary to begin opening our doors. Below are some of the 
                         precautions we are now taking in order to protect our guests, our team, 
                         and our community.
                         <ul>
                             <li><strong>Masks are required for all visitors.</strong> We have made these available to our stylists and guests at cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gloves are required for all stylists. </strong> They are required to change them often as required by law.</li>
                            <li><strong>Symptoms checking and temperature logging of all staff prior to shift.</strong> Results are logged for inspection by the Health Department.</li>
                            <li><strong>Screening of all guests prior to entry.</strong> We have supplied all of our team with a screening questionnaires to be used with each guest prior to entry.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self distancing is required for everyone in the salon</strong> except for stylists and the guest they are servicing. This means we have reduced capacity as we now have fewer wash stations and dryer stations.</li> 
                            <li><strong>We are allowing extra time for thorough cleaning</strong> between every guest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Please check-in and then wait in your car until your service provider is ready. </strong>We have reduced our lobby capacity to allow 6 ft of distance between all guests and staff.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cleaning checklists are performed after each guest and logged</strong>regularly throughout the day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The decision to re-open is not an easy one. When deciding to be serviced 
                        at a hair salon, social distancing between the guest and the stylist is not
                         possible to be maintained. With that, we must all not only take the 
                         precautions given to us by our health department, but we should go above 
                         and beyond those measures in every way possible. Our Independent Stylists, 
                         as well as our guests should assess their personal situation and level of 
                         risk and not take that decision lightly. When in the salon, it is critical 
                         that unless a service is being performed, that all other people maintain 
                         distancing as well as increased levels of cleaning and precaution.

                    MASKS WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ALL VISITORS.<br> <br>
                    If you don't have a mask, you will not be allowed to enter our salon. We have made
                     them available with the front desk at cost. You can also order one FOR FREE from A 
                     Mask For Every Utahn program. You can order one for free through their website.

                    <strong>April 23, 2020 - Plans and challenges for re-opening.</strong> <br>
                    We are getting increasing requests about when we are going to re-open. We want to re-open 
                    as soon as we can, however we will be following guidance from the Salt Lake County Health 
                    Department and the Utah Leads Together State recovery plan. <br> <br>
                    Our current plan is to re-open at restricted capacity with increased sanitation measures on 
                    May 1st, however this may get pushed back to a later date.

                    <strong>April 18, 2020 - New site launched!</strong><br>
                    We've launched our new website! This new site comes with a ton of great enhancements, 
                    primarily an online store that will allow us to sell products online and deliver curbside. 
                    All purchases can be linked to stylists to help them earn commissions while we are temporarily 
                    closed. Thank you for supporting your local stylist!

                    <strong>March 20, 2020 - Temporarily closed to keep our friends safe.</strong> <br>
                    For the well-being of the staff, guests, and families, we have decided to temporarily close 
                    our doors in an effort to aid in the slowing of the spread of COVID-19. <br>
                    Our stylists will be reaching out to everyone with appointments that need to be rescheduled. 
                    Please continue to check our Instagram and website for updates and expected reopening dates. <br>
                    We appreciate the outpouring of support from you all!<br>
                    Take care, and be well!

                    <strong>March 25, 2020 - We are giving free booth rent to our stylists for April</strong><br>
                    As we've been watching this global crisis progress, we realize that it will be extremely challenging 
                    for our stylists to pay for their booth rental space in April. So, even though we are still on the hook 
                    to pay our lease, we have decided to grant all of our team free rent for April. We hope this will allow 
                    them the time to focus on their personal and family health while we figure out when we can get back to work.
